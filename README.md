# Node.js Server Error Handling Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in Node.js server development: improper error handling within asynchronous request handlers.  The server crashes without sending a proper error response to the client, leading to a poor user experience and making debugging difficult.

## Bug Description

The bug occurs in the `bug.js` file.  The server uses `res.destroy()` to handle errors thrown by an asynchronous operation. This abruptly closes the connection without sending any response back to the client.  Clients may receive a connection reset error or simply timeout.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version. The solution correctly sends an error response (e.g., a 500 Internal Server Error) to the client. Even though an error occurred, the server handles this gracefully. This provides better feedback to the client, making debugging easier.
